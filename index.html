      <p>
        Hello! My name is Moïse Marc-Aurel MASSAMBA-DILUEKI, and I’m from the
        Republic of Congo, specifically Brazzaville. I’m a passionate and
        curious individual with a deep interest in technology and its potential
        to transform lives and communities. My main areas of focus include
        software development, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial
        Intelligence (AI), all of which I see as powerful tools for addressing
        practical challenges in Africa and beyond. I love creating innovative
        solutions that respond to real-world needs. One of the projects I’m
        currently working on is called NguyaEco, a smart application designed
        to help households monitor and optimize their electricity consumption.
        Through this project, I aim to promote energy efficiency, reduce costs,
        and raise awareness about sustainable living. Beyond development, I
        dedicate a lot of time to self-improvement. I’m currently working on
        strengthening my English skills to better communicate, collaborate
        internationally, and access a broader range of knowledge. I’m also
        always exploring new technologies, reading about emerging trends, and
        experimenting with different tools to stay up-to-date and grow as a
        developer and innovator. In the long term, I aspire to use my skills to
        create impactful tech solutions that uplift communities, support
        education, and promote environmental responsibility across Africa. I
        strongly believe that even small ideas, when nurtured with passion and
        determination, can lead to meaningful change.

        The Republic of Congo, located in Central Africa, is a country rich in
        natural resources, dense rainforests, and vibrant cultural traditions.
        One of its most unique and colorful subcultures is La Sape, short for
        Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes—a fashion movement
        known as Sapologie. Sapologie celebrates dandyism, where primarily men
        dress in flamboyant, high-end European fashion, often contrasting
        sharply with their modest surroundings. More than just style, Sapologie
        is a statement of dignity, self-expression, and resistance, deeply
        embedded in the urban identity of cities like Brazzaville
