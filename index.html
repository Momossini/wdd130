        Hello! My name is Moïse Marc-Aurel MASSAMBA-DILUEKI from Republic of
        Congo (Brazzaville). I’m passionate about technology, especially
        software development, IoT, and AI. I enjoy working on innovative
        projects that solve real-life problems, like NguyaEco, an application
        I’m developing to help optimize electricity consumption in households.
        In my free time, I also love learning new skills, improving my English,
        and exploring new ideas that can make a positive impact on my community.

      <p>The Republic of Congo, located in Central Africa, is a country rich in natural resources, dense rainforests, and vibrant cultural traditions. One of its most unique and colorful subcultures is La Sape, short for Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes—a fashion movement known as Sapologie. Sapologie celebrates dandyism, where primarily men dress in flamboyant, high-end European fashion, often contrasting sharply with their modest surroundings. More than just style, Sapologie is a statement of dignity, self-expression, and resistance, deeply embedded in the urban identity of cities like Brazzaville</p>
